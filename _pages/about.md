### **About Me**  
Multiphysics Modelling Engineer specialising in AI-accelerated computational modelling. Passionate about developing advanced numerical solutions to solve high-impact, complex, and multidisciplinary engineering challenges in the energy transition.

### **Selected Research Projects**  
I have worked on a variety of projects, including, but not limited to:

- **Agentic LLMs for Science:** Automating tasks in computational science using agentic LLMs.
- **Accelerating Chemically Reacting Flow Simulations:** Using machine learning to elegantly speed up simulations of chemically reacting flows by three orders of magnitude.
- **Developing a 3D Viscous Unstructured Turbomachinery Flow Solver:** Creating an unstructured mesh flow solver designed for both multiple GPUs and CPUs.
- **Chemical Kinetic Solvers with Embedded Multi-Objective Optimizers:** Developing solvers that incorporate multi-objective optimization techniques for improved reaction performance.
- **High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD):** Using high-fidelity CFD to investigate complex aerothermal, supersonic, highly turbulent interactions in a novel turbomachinery concept aimed at decarbonizing over 40 high-temperature processes.
